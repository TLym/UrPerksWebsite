                    As real estate agents, we have all been told that one of the most valuable farms you can build for your 
                    real estate business is a network of business owners. </p>
                <p>
                    Business owners tend to be higher earners, and that is reflected in the price tag on the real estate they own. 
                    Additionally, they are more likely to own multiple pieces of real estate (their personal residence, business property, 
                    and other investment properties). They also tend to have a larger network of people who they influence (other local 
                    business owners in addition to their friends and family). </p>                    
                <p>
                    A farm of business owners is clearly valuable. </p>
                <p>
                    The question is: how do you build one? </p>
                

                
                
                <!-- <p>We help Real Estate agents build one of the most valuable farms possible in their market – a 
                    farm of business owners.</p>
                <p>
                    Research shows that real estate agents’ best path to building and maintaining a strong sustainable 
                    business is by building a referral based business, and they know this – they are taught the importance 
                    of this in many trainings offered to the industry. </p>
                <p>
                    One of the most valuable referral networks possible in any given market is a referral network of business 
                    owners. Business owners are wealthier on average, and typically own more real estate (their personal residence, 
                    business property, and potentially other investment properties). 
                </p>
                <p>
                    How do real estate agents get business owners to start referring real estate transaction business to them? 
                    The real estate agent must be top of mind in those business owners’ heads, when they come to needing a realtor. 
                    How dose an agent get to be top of mind? They add significant value to the business owner, and they regularly keep 
                    in touch. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The industry also currently has a big disrupter, with discount real estate transaction services being offered to 
                    the consumer (such as homie), putting real estate agents’ historically large commissions at risk.
